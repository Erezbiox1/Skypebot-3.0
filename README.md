# Skypebot-3.0
A better version of my previous bot, now supporting multiple groups!

This bot is basicly a better version of my first on, I recoded 90% of the old code, I've add multi group support and a lot more.
Lets say you own a forum, Now, you want to hire some guys to staff it? right? but, you don't want them to have your skype account? well what do you do?
Very simple, you use Skypebot! skypebot will send them each message that you'll write and Vis-versa. The bot also support Commands! and a lot of other cool stuff,
I'm just too board to edit this readme right now, If you want to see more features, just look at the code, there
